# Real-world programming in Lean

This repository showcases "real-world" programming in Lean through the example of `lean-slides`, a tool to turn comments written in Lean into slides rendered in the infoview.

This demo is prepared to be demonstrated at the Imperial College reading group on the 11th of November 2025.
